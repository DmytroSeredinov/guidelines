## What ü§î

uFeatures is a architectural approach to structure iOS applications to enable scalability, optimizing build and testing cycles, and ensuring good practices in your team. Its core idea is to build your apps by building independent features that are interconnected using clear and concise APIS.

This manifesto introduces the principles of the architecture, helping you identify and organize your application features in different layers. It also introduces tips, tools and advices if you decide for this architecture.

> The name uFeatures (Microfeatures)* is inspired by the backend Microservices architecture, where different "backend features" run as different services with defined APIS to enable communication between them.

## Context ü•ë

Apps are made of features. Typically these features are part of the same module, or target where the whole application is defined. The natural inclination in the team is to continue building features and its tests in the same targets. As a result, the application and its tests target grows in complexity which manifests in bugs, bad compilation times, and team performance. What seemed to be a good architecture, doesn't work out that well in large codebases or teams.

**This is frequently a big source of frustration when it comes to work on those projects. The time we spend goes into compiling rather than building and experimenting with the platform.**

## Motivation üçé

The ¬µFeatures's main motivation is to support the scalability of large iOS codebases leveraging platform features and tools. There are other solutions out there that could be also be considered to overcome those issues. A very popular one nowadays is [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) that leverages the Javascript dynamism to offer developers a pleasant experience working in the code base, but at the same time a native experience from the user point of view.

**We believe that the usage of native tools and technologies can be optimized to overcome scalability challenges that sooner or later show up in our projects**

## Before reading üçí

- Don't expect this to be a silver-bullet to your problems. You should take the core ideas, process them, and apply the principles to your project/s.
- Each project is different so are the needs. With the ideas in the manifesto, and your needs, you should figure out what might work out for you.
- Since everything this architecture depends on is evolving *(tools, languages, concepts)*, this might get outdated very quickly. If that happens, don't hesitate to open a PR and contribute with keeping this manifesto up to date.
